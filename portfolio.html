      <h3>"Abnormality" | Photoshop, Audacity | 2018</h3>
      <p>This image of the upside car is already unusual, without the glitch, but I want it to seem more out of this world. I wanted to make it more unclear, because I want my viewers to observe, think, and question when they look at my piece. Curiosity is a good thing. This image is from the internet and I felt attached to it because it was it represents my thoughts. My opinions are usually different from my peers, just like how this car is different from the other cars. I do not want to filter the photo too much, because I want the original picture itself to speak. The glitches surrounding the original pictures are supposed to emphasis the abnormality.</p>

  <h3>"Afternoon Rush" | Illustrator, Audacity | 2018</h3>
  <p>I put together kitchen noises, like the sound of knives, cutting, water splashing, frying, boiling, etc. I also included muffled talking because the setting is in a restaurant, and the talking is from the customers. I wanted a realistic setting and I wanted the layers in my sound to demonstrate a fast paced environment. The faint violin music in the background enhances the feeling of business, work, and rush.</p>

<p><a href="https://monayou.github.io/code-art/">Music festivals and raves are a way for people to let go, but sometimes, they let go too hard. Anything could happen. Based on a true story, this is a clip demonstrating what could happen if you're UTI, dehydrated, and alone. I used video, glitch effects, and audacity. The video and glitch effects portray the distortion of reality, which often happens when one is UTI. I distorted the sound towards the beat drop of the video because one's hearing could also be distorted. I myself have experienced the muffled "wah wah" noises before I almost fainted once.
