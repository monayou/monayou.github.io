  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My artwork is personal. It is inspired from my life experiences, from my childhood to my teenage life to now. I am more passionate about creating something I connect to, so that is why I use my past reflections to help me create the works in my portfolio. Ever since I could remember I loved playing with colors and making different color combinations, which is something I plan to do with my website. I am very aware of color composition, and how colors work together to make objects and words pop. I want the viewer to observe and learn from my life. They will become apart of it as they scroll through my works and view the website as a whole.
